# Dr. Pooja's Physio — agent guide

Production web app for a virtual physical therapy practice: public marketing
site, patient booking and payments, therapist scheduling and earnings,
hospital (B2B) referrals, and an admin back office. `README.md` has the full
product and setup description; this file is the working context for coding
agents.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 ·
Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime) · Razorpay · Google
Calendar/Meet (`googleapis`) · `motion` for animation · Font Awesome ·
`libphonenumber-js`.

Commands: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm start`, `npm run lint`.
There is no test runner configured — verify with `npm run build` and
`npm run lint`.

## Layout

```
src/app/                 pages, layouts, API route handlers
src/app/api/**           POST route handlers grouped by audience:
                         admin/, appointments/, patient/, therapist/,
                         hospital/, packages/, razorpay/
src/components/          UI, grouped by area (admin/, auth/, booking/,
                         dashboard/, home/, hospital/, profile/, motion/,

src/lib/                 domain logic, formatting, Supabase clients
src/proxy.ts             auth proxy over the four dashboard route trees
supabase/schema.sql      the entire schema: tables, RLS, views, triggers
scripts/                 one-off tooling
```

## Roles and access

`profiles.role` is one of `patient`, `therapist`, `hospital`, `admin`.
Patients and therapists self-register and wait for approval; hospitals are
provisioned by the admin; admins are promoted by hand in Supabase.

Two flags gate everything: `profiles.approved` and `profiles.active`.
They are enforced in **two** places and both must stay in place:

1. `src/proxy.ts` → `src/lib/supabase/proxy.ts` for dashboard navigation.
2. `src/lib/supabase/requireActiveProfile.ts` inside self-service API routes,
   because a valid session cookie can call the API directly around the UI.

Admin routes go through `src/lib/supabase/requireAdmin.ts`. Never trust a
role, an id, or an amount sent from the client — re-derive it server-side.

## Supabase clients — pick the right one

- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser, anon key, RLS applies.
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — server components / route handlers, acts as
  the signed-in user.
- `src/lib/supabase/public.ts` — unauthenticated server reads of public data.
- `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` — service role, **bypasses RLS**. Server-only.
  Use it only after an explicit auth check, and never import it into anything
  that can reach the browser.

## Schema conventions

- `supabase/schema.sql` is the single source of truth and is re-runnable:
  guarded with `if not exists` / `or replace`, with later sections adding
  columns to earlier tables. Add changes at the **end** of the file in that
  same guarded style; do not rewrite earlier statements.
- New columns are migration-dependent — a live database may not have them
  yet. Query such a column in its own isolated call and merge the result in
  (see `src/lib/sessionCode.ts`), so one unknown-column error can't blank
  every field of a shared query.
- Money is integer paise. Times are `timestamptz`. Percentages
  (`revenue_share_percent`) are 0–100.
- Any new table needs RLS policies written alongside it in the same file.

## Domain rules worth knowing before editing

- **Booking lead time** is 12 hours, defined once in `src/lib/bookingSlots.ts`
  and shared by the picker and the validator so they cannot drift apart.
- **Availability** = weekly template + per-date overrides + leave flag, then a
  conflict check (`src/lib/therapistAvailability.ts`,
  `src/lib/checkTherapistConflict.ts`).
- **Payments** must be verified server-side: `/api/razorpay/verify` checks the
  signature before anything is confirmed. Never confirm on a client callback.
- **Cancellation/refund**: full refund only outside the 24-hour window in
  `src/lib/pricing.ts`; inside it, none.
- **Google Calendar/Meet sync must never block a booking.** Failures are
  recorded on the appointment (`google_calendar_sync_error`) and retried by
  the admin (`/api/admin/retry-meet-sync`).
- **Session packages lock to one therapist by default.** The first therapist
  assigned to any session on a `patient_package_purchases` row sets
  `locked_therapist_id`; every later session on that purchase auto-assigns,
  auto-confirms, and gets its own Meet link via
  `src/lib/bookPackageSession.ts`, never through the normal per-session admin
  assignment flow. `sessions_used` counts sessions **claimed** (scheduled or
  completed), not completed — see the counter-semantics comment beside
  `patient_package_purchases` in `schema.sql`. A scheduling conflict on the
  locked therapist never fails the booking; the session lands `requested`
  and unassigned in the admin queue instead. Reassigning a whole programme
  (`/api/admin/reassign-package-therapist`) only ever touches future
  sessions — completed ones keep whoever actually ran them. A patient can
  schedule several remaining sessions in one request via
  `/api/appointments/book-package-sessions`, which loops
  `bookPackageSession()` per slot after enforcing the package's own
  minimum-gap/max-per-week rules and the bulk limit — it's the batch-level
  rules layer, not a second booking implementation.
- **No cron or background worker exists in this deployment.** Anything that
  needs to happen "when time passes" (a package purchase's `status` moving
  from `active` to `expired` past `expires_at`) runs as a lazy, idempotent
  sweep at the top of a relevant page's render instead of on a schedule —
  see `src/lib/expirePackagePurchases.ts`, called from both the admin and
  patient dashboard pages before their own reads. Follow this pattern
  rather than reaching for a cron job or a queue.
- **Package detail is viewer-scoped, not role-branched.**
  `/api/packages/purchase-detail` queries `patient_package_purchases` with
  the caller's own RLS-scoped client rather than checking role: the two
  `package_purchases_select_*` policies already encode exactly who may see
  a given purchase, so a row coming back at all *is* the authorization
  check. Only the one cross-role name lookup RLS can't provide (the other
  party's name) uses the admin client. Don't add a manual ownership branch
  here or you'll duplicate what the policies already guarantee.
- **Business math lives in dependency-free `src/lib/` modules** (`pricing`,
  `adminMetrics`, `therapistEarnings`, `therapistPayouts`, `ratingAggregate`,
  `packageProgress`) so it can be reasoned about without rendering. Keep new
  math there rather than inside components.
- **Admin-configurable behavior** (Meet on/off, join window, idle timeout,
  booking languages, and the package-wide settings — visibility, default
  validity, therapist-lock switch, bulk-scheduler limit, expiry reminder
  window) is read through `src/lib/adminSettings.ts` with defaults — don't
  hardcode these. Every dashboard page must select
  `SITE_SETTINGS_SELECT` from that module rather than its own column list,
  or a new setting silently reads as its default on whichever page forgot
  it.

## Keeping the docs current

`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` describe the app itself, so they go
stale the moment the app changes. Update them **in the same change** that
makes them wrong — do not leave it for later, and do not merge to `main`
without checking. Anything in this list means the docs need a look:

- a new or removed route, page, or API route handler
- a new role, or a change to how `approved` / `active` gate access
- a new environment variable, or a changed meaning for an existing one
- a schema change in `supabase/schema.sql` that affects a documented flow
- a change to a documented rule: booking lead time, cancellation/refund
  window, payment verification, Meet sync behavior, payout math
- a new npm script, dependency, or build/deploy step

`.github/workflows/docs-freshness.yml` warns on a pull request that touches
`src/`, `supabase/`, `scripts/`, `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, or
`.env.example` without touching a doc. It is a reminder, not a gate — a
change that genuinely needs no doc update can ignore it.

## Style

- TypeScript throughout; no `any` escapes for convenience.
- Tailwind utility classes; design tokens and font stacks are composed in
  `src/app/globals.css` (`--font-sans`, `--font-display`). Fonts are
  self-hosted via `next/font/google` — no runtime request to Google.
- Server components by default; add `"use client"` only where interaction
  requires it.
- Comments in this codebase explain *why*, especially where a non-obvious
  constraint or a past bug drove the shape of the code. Match that.

## Gotchas

- `.env.production` sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_DEBUG_NAV=true` for a debug nav bar
  on the deployed site. It must be removed before a public launch.
- `graphify-out/` is CI-generated (`.github/workflows/graphify.yml`); only
  `graph.json` and `GRAPH_REPORT.md` are committed. Don't hand-edit them.
- Secrets (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, Google
  credentials) are server-only. Never add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix to them and
  never commit real values.
